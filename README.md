# PyCalcTK
A basic calculator through python's tkinter library from that you can create a GUI(Graphical User Interface) based application. The source code has some bugs but i am currently patching them some bugs will be fixed and in v1.0_devbuild_2 you may not see. I decided to add a dark mode and add more operations to my calculator on its future updates and feel free to report any bugs\
